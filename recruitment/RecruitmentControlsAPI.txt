Public API functions

--------------------------------------------------------
MAIN API: Commands to register units and give them caps. 

Command: 
	rm:add_unit_to_group("unit_key", "group_key")
Description
	Adds a unit to a group with that key. The group can be literally any string, its just a string match. If the group hasn't been used before the script will autocreate it.
	--note: all units must be added to the group before the group's quantity limit is set.
	
Command:
	rm:add_character_quantity_limit_for_group("group_key", ##quantity##)
Description:
	Sets the quantity limit for units in that group.
	
Command: 
	rm:add_character_quantity_limit_for_unit("unit_key", ##quantity##)
Description:
	Sets the quantity limit for a specific unit. 
	Keep in mind that unit weight doesn't matter here, only in groups. If the unit has weight 3, I don't need to set the limit at 9 to get three of them. 
	
Command:
	rm:whitelist_unit_for_subculture("unit_key", "sc_key")
Description:
	Sets the unit to only be checked by that subculture. If nothing is set then every subculture will check those units. 
	This can cause noticable lag if a subculture is checking more than 250 units, which is why this whitelist exists.

Command:
	rm:set_weight_for_unit("unit_key", ##weight##)
Description:
	Sets a in group weight for the unit. This causes the unit to count for multiple in groups. 
	--note: mild bugs as of 7/26, still working on the restriction enforcement.
	
Command:
	rm:add_unit_to_already_initialized_group("unit_key", "group_key")
Description:
	Adds a unit to a group and functions properly even if that group's cap has already been set.
	Do not do this for large numbers of units unless you want to increase the player's loading time. For small numbers it is fine, but > 30 will be a problem.
	Why? Because I've got to completely deconstruct the check queue for that unit and any others in the group then reconstruct them each time this is called. 

--------------------------------------------------------
UI API: to add some better user feedback to the settings.

Command: 
	rm:set_ui_profile_for_unit("unit_key", {_text = "Tooltip Text", _image = "ui/custom/example_image.png"})
Description:
	Sets a image with a tooltip to appear on the unit card. the _text piece is the tooltip, while the _image piece is the path to the image you want displayed. 
	This will only display on the unit card in the recruitment menu, not everywhere. 
	
Command:
	rm:set_ui_name_for_group("group_key", "Group Name")
Description:
	Sets the UI name of the group. This can make things look nicer if your group name is something like emp_steam_tanks. 

--OTHER API: Other useful functions
-----------------------------------

Command:
	rm:error_checker()
Description:
	Wraps listener functions in pcall with logging. 
	Useful for finding script errors.
	
Command: 
	rm:log("message")
Description:
	Writes a message to the RM log. Useful if you want your functions to show on that log.

Command:
	rm:full_reset()
Description:
	Wipes out all caps, whitelists, weights, groups, groupcaps, queues, armies, and any other stored data held by the model or its subobjects.
	Only to be used if you want to wipe the slate clean to load your own fully custom lists as a submod.
